# Task-1_Elivate_Labs_DA_Internship
This task involved cleaning and preprocessing the Marketing Campaign Dataset to prepare it for analysis. Missing values were handled, duplicates removed, and text columns standardized. Column names were formatted uniformly, and date and numeric data types were corrected. The cleaned dataset was then saved as a new CSV file for further analysis.
